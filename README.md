Client-Demo
===========

Add this script and a set of images into a directory to create a quick website mockup demo.

Visiting the directory will display a set of thumbnails.

Clicking through to a thumbnail will take the user to a full view of the image.

Clicking anywhere on the full view will take the user to the next image in the directory.

The script will check for the colour of the top left of the image, and set the HTML background colour to match.
